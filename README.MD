# Faketime Operator

> :warning: Version 0.1 - under development

For some testing purposes it is useful to set another time to a kubernetes container.
Using [libfaketime](https://github.com/wolfcw/libfaketime)❤️ can handle this problem.

With the operator it will be possible to automatic add the library to newly created containers.
